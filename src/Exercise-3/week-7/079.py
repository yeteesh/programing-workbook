# Binary to Decimal
'''Write a program that converts a binary (base 2) number to decimal (base 10). Your
program should begin by reading the binary number from the user as a string. Then
it should compute the equivalent decimal number by processing each digit in the
binary number. Finally, your program should display the equivalent decimal number
with an appropriate message.'''
