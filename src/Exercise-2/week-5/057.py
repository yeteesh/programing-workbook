## Next Day
'''Write a program that reads a date from the user and computes its immediate successor.
For example, if the user enters values that represent 2019-11-18 then your program
should display a message indicating that the day immediately after 2019-11-18 is
2019-11-19. If the user enters values that represent 2019-11-30 then the program
should indicate that the next day is 2019-12-01. If the user enters values that represent
2019-12-31 then the program should indicate that the next day is 2020-01-01. The
date will be entered in numeric form with three separate input statements; one for
the year, one for the month, and one for the day. Ensure that your program works
correctly for leap years.'''
