# Current Time
'''Python’s time module includes several time-related functions. One of these is the
asctime function which reads the current time from the computer’s internal clock
and returns it in a human-readable format. Use this function to write a program that
displays the current time and date. Your program will not require any input from the
user.'''
import time
print(time.asctime())
