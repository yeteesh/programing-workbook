## Heat Capacity
'''The amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a material
by one degree Celsius is the material’s specific heat capacity, C. The total amount
of energy, q, required to raise m grams of a material by ΔT degrees Celsius can be
computed using the formula:'''
import math
print('Enter the amount of water in milliters')
x = int(input())
