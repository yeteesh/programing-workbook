## Sum of the First n Positive Integers
'''
Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the
sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be
computed using the formula: sum = (n)(n+1)/2
'''
value = ('Enter a value, it has to be positive:')
print(value) 
value1 = int(input()) 
n = value1
(n)*(n+1)/2
