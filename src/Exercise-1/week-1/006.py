## Widgets and Gizmos
'''
An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75
grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of
widgets and the number of gizmos from the user. Then your program should compute
and display the total weight of the parts.'''

print ('Hello welcome to Costco to day we will put Widgets and gizmos on sale. Each widget weighs 75 grams and each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Please select the amount of gizmos or widgets you want. ')
x = (input(''))
gizmo = (112)

A = gizmo
B = widget
if A > B:
