# Arbitrary Base Conversions
'''Write a program that allows the user to convert a number from one base to another.
Your program should support bases between 2 and 16 for both the input number and
the result number. If the user chooses a base outside of this range then an appropriate
error message should be displayed and the program should exit. Divide your program
into several functions, including a function that converts from an arbitrary base to
base 10, a function that converts from base 10 to an arbitrary base, and a main
program that reads the bases and input number from the user. You may find your
solutions to Exercises 81(Binary to Decimal), 82(Decimal to Binary) and 104(Hexadecimal Decimal Digit) helpful when completing this exercise.'''
