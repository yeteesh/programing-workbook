# Magic Dates
'''A magic date is a date where the day multiplied by the month is equal to the two digit
year. For example, June 10, 1960 is a magic date because June is the sixth month, and
6 times 10 is 60, which is equal to the two digit year. Write a function that determines
whether or not a date is a magic date. Use your function to create a main program
that finds and displays all of the magic dates in the 20th century. You will probably
find your solution to Exercise 106 helpful when completing this exercise.'''
