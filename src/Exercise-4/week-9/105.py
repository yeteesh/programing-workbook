# Reduce a Fraction to Lowest Terms
'''Write a function that takes two positive integers that represent the numerator and
denominator of a fraction as its only parameters. The body of the function should
reduce the fraction to lowest terms and then return both the numerator and denom-
inator of the reduced fraction as its result. For example, if the parameters passed
to the function are 6 and 63 then the function should return 2 and 21. Include a
main program that allows the user to enter a numerator and denominator. Then your
program should display the reduced fraction.

Hint: In Exercise 79 (Greatest common Divisor)you wrote a program for computing the greatest common
divisor of two positive integers. You may find that code useful when complet-
ing this exercise
