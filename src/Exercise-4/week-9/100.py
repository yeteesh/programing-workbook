# Check a Password
'''In this exercise you will write a function that determines whether or not a password
is good. We will define a good password to be a one that is at least 8 characters long
and contains at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, and at least
one number. Your function should return True if the password passed to it as its
only parameter is good. Otherwise it should return False. Include a main program
that reads a password from the user and reports whether or not it is good. Ensure
that your main program only runs when your solution has not been imported into
another file.'''
