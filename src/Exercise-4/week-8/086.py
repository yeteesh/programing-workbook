# Median of Three Values
'''Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters, and returns the median value
of those parameters as its result. Include a main program that reads three values from
the user and displays their median.

Hint: The median value is the middle of the three values when they are sorted
into ascending order. It can be found using if statements, or with a little bit of
mathematical creativity.
