# Ordinal Date to Gregorian Date
'''Create a function that takes an ordinal date, consisting of a year and a day within in
that year, as its parameters. The function will return the day and month correspond-
ing to that ordinal date as its results. Ensure that your function handles leap years
correctly.
    
    Use your function, as well as the ordinalDate function that you wrote previ-
ously, to create a program that reads a date from the user. Then your program should
report a second date that occurs some number of days later. For example, your pro-
gram could read the date a product was purchased and then report the last date that
it can be returned (based on a return period that is a particular number of days), or
your program could compute the due date for a baby based on a gestation period of
280 days. Ensure that your program correctly handles cases where the entered date
and the computed date occur in different years.'''
